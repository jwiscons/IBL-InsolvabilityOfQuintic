# IBL-InsolvabilityOfQuintic
IBL course materials for a second-semester undergraduate abstract algebra course that is framed around showing that there are quintic polynomials not solvable by radicals. 

## Overview
This is a free, open-source textbook designed to guide students towards a proof that there exists quintic polynomials that are not solvable by radicals. It is intended to be used in a second-semester undergraduate abtract algebra course; the necessary background can be found in the (free, open-source) textbook [An Inquiry-Based Approach to Abstract Algebra](https://github.com/dcernst/IBL-AbstractAlgebra) by [Dana C. Ernst](http://danaernst.com). As with Dana's book, this one is designed to used with an [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) approach. The presentation of the material is heavily influenced by the book [Abstract Algebra: A Concrete Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Abstract-Algebra-Introduction-Robert-Redfield/dp/020143721X) by [Robert H. Redfield](https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/our-faculty/directory/faculty-detail/robert-redfield); as such, the development is: fields, rings, (a revisitation of) groups, insolvability of the quintic.

At present, the main contributor is me ([Joshua Wiscons](http://webpages.csus.edu/wiscons/)).

## Editions
### Fall 2019.
It's complete and was used in Fall 2019 as it ws being written. (Let me ([Joshua Wiscons](mailto:joshua.wiscons@csus.edu)) know if you have implementation specific questions, or try visiting the [course website](http://webpages.csus.edu/wiscons/teaching/math110B_f19.html).)
* In my opinion, the notes are a bit too full, especially in the chapter on Rings. Regardless, to make the notes work, I didn't ask my students to prove all theorems (but they were responsible for reading and being able to use everything). 
* My implemention saw much of the final chapter woven in to a final project.
* I think it went very well, but there are many things to improve.
