In Chapter~\ref{chapter:PolyEquations}, we explored problems about finding and expressing roots of polynomials, finally arriving at the goal of the course: proving that there are quintic polynomials that are \emph{not} solvable by radicals. This chapter serves two main purposes. First, as we look at roots of polynomials and how they can be expressed, it will be convenient to have a common world (i.e.~number system) in which they live. For us, this will be the complex numbers, denoted $\mathbb{C}$, which will be reviewed below. Our work with complex numbers will also supply the necessary language to properly talk about $n^{\text{th}}$-roots. Second, we are still in need of a proper definition of what it means for a polynomial to be ``solvable by radicals''; this is where the chapter will finish. But the middle of the chapter is perhaps the most interesting. There, on the way to defining ``solvable by radicals'', we will be led to abstract the structure of $\mathbb{C}$ (and of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$), arriving at the definition of a \emph{field}. 

\begin{section}{Complex Numbers}
As mentioned above, we want to work in a world that contains all of the roots of all of the polynomials that we will be studying. Considering the roots of polynomials such as $x^2 +1$, $x^2-2$, $x^2-3$, etc., we see that we need to include numbers like $\sqrt{-1}$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, etc., so although there are smaller worlds one could choose, we will opt for the world containing both $\sqrt{-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}$, namely $\mathbb{C}$.

But before we proceed, note that $\sqrt{-1}$ is not really well defined. There are \emph{two} solutions to $x^2 +1$, so when we write $\sqrt{-1}$, we are all agreeing that we mean the same one. 

\begin{definition}
Let $i$ (or alternatively $\sqrt{-1}$) denote one particular solution to $x^2 +1$. 
\end{definition}

Of course, the previous definition implies that $i^2 = -1$. Using $i$ and $\mathbb{R}$, we now build the complex numbers.

\begin{definition}
The \textbf{complex numbers}, denoted  $\mathbb{C}$, is the set $\{a + bi\mid a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$. If $z\in \mathbb{C}$ and $z$ is written as $z=a+bi$, then $a$ is called the \textbf{real part} of $z$ and $b$ is called the \textbf{imaginary part} of $z$.
\end{definition}

Note that every complex number $z=a+bi$ is uniquely determined by two numbers: the real and imaginary parts $a$ and $b$. As such, we often graph complex numbers in the coordinate plane with the $x$-axis denoting the real part and the $y$-axis denoting the imaginary part. This will be called the \textbf{complex plane}.

\begin{example}
We graph $-2 + 2i$ and  $1 - 3i$ below.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[line width = .9,scale = .7]
\draw[<->] (-4,0) -- (4,0) node [below] {\small \textsc{Real}};
\draw[<->] (0,-4) -- (0,4) node [left] {\small \textsc{Imag.}};
\foreach \i in {1,2,3} {
\draw (-\i,-0.1) -- (-\i,0.1);
\draw (\i,-0.1) -- (\i,0.1);
\node[anchor = 90] at (-\i,0) {\small $\i$};
\node[anchor = 90] at (\i,0) {\small $\i$};
\draw (-0.1,-\i) -- (0.1,-\i);
\draw (-0.1,\i) -- (0.1,\i);
\node[anchor = 0] at (0,-\i) {\small $\i$};
\node[anchor = 0] at (0,\i) {\small $\i$};
}
\node (w) at (-2,2) {};
\fill (w) circle (.1);
\node[anchor = -10] at (w) {\small $-2 + 2i$};
\node (z) at (1,-3) {};
\fill (z) circle (.1);
\node[anchor = 170] at (z) {\small $1 - 3i$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{example}

We also define some operations on complex numbers.

\begin{definition}
Consider the complex numbers $a+bi$ and $c+di$. We define the following operations.
\begin{description}
\item [Addition:] $(a+bi) + (c+di) := (a+b) + (c+d)i$
\item [Multiplication:] $(a+bi) \cdot (c+di) := (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i$
\item [Complex Conjugation:] $\overline{a+bi} := a-bi$
\end{description}
\end{definition}

Notice that in the definition of complex multiplication we are just using the normal distributive law (or FOIL if you like) together with the fact that $i^2 = -1$.

\begin{problem}
Thinking of a complex number $z$ as a point in the complex plane, describe \emph{geometrically} what happens when $(c+di)$ is added to $z$. Also, describe \emph{geometrically}  how to find $\overline{z}$ from $z$.
\end{problem}

When we plot points, there are different coordinate systems we could use. It turns out that  rectangular coordinates are good for adding complex numbers, but polar coordinates are better for multiplication. This lead to the following definition.

\begin{definition}
Let $z=a+bi$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textbf{modulus} of $z$, denoted $|z|$, is the radius of the point $(a,b)$ when written in polar coordinates. Thus, $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. 
\item The \textbf{argument} of $z$, denoted $\Arg(z)$, is the angle of the point $(a,b)$ when written in polar coordinates. Thus, $\Arg(z)$ is the angle $\theta$ \emph{in the appropriate quadrant} such that $0\le \theta<2\pi$ and $\tan \theta = \frac{b}{a}$. The argument of  $0$ is undefined.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
We have that $|-2 + 2i| = \sqrt{(-2)^2+2^2} = 2\sqrt{2}$ and $\Arg(-2 + 2i) = \frac{3\pi}{4}$. But be careful, $\arctan(-1) = \frac{\pi}{4}$; you must pay attention to which quadrant the number is in.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[line width = .9,scale = .7]
\small
\draw[<->] (-4,0) -- (4,0) node [below] { \textsc{Real}};
\draw[<->] (0,-3) -- (0,3) node [left] { \textsc{Imag.}};
\foreach \i in {1,2,3} {
\draw (-\i,-0.1) -- (-\i,0.1);
\draw (\i,-0.1) -- (\i,0.1);
\node[anchor = 90] at (-\i,0) { $\i$};
\node[anchor = 90] at (\i,0) { $\i$};
}
\foreach \i in {1,2} {
\draw (-0.1,-\i) -- (0.1,-\i);
\draw (-0.1,\i) -- (0.1,\i);
\node[anchor = 0] at (0,-\i) { $\i$};
\node[anchor = 0] at (0,\i) { $\i$};
}
\node (w) at (-2,2) {};
\fill (w) circle (.1);
\node[anchor = -10] at (w) { $-2 + 2i$};

\draw [dashed] (0,0) -- (w.center);
\draw [blue,domain=0:135,->] plot ({1.2*cos(\x)}, {1.2*sin(\x)});
\node[blue] at (1.25,1.25) {$\frac{3\pi}{4}$};

\draw [red,decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=10pt},xshift=-4pt,yshift=0pt]
(0,0) -- (w.center);
\node[red] at (-2.2,0.6) {$2\sqrt{2}$}; 
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{problem}\label{prob.ComplexCheckin}
For each of the following complex numbers,
\begin{itemize}
\item write it in the form $a+bi$ (if it is not already),
\item plot it in the complex plane,
\item find the modulus and argument (if not exact, then a decimal approximation is okay).
\end{itemize}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $u = -1-i$
\item $v= \frac{1}{1+i}$
\item $w = \frac{(2-i)(1+2i)}{2+3i}$
\item $z\in \mathbb{C}$ with $|z| = 3$ and $\Arg(z) = \frac{4\pi}{3}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
\end{problem}

Given a complex number in the form $a+ib$, we know how to find the modulus and argument (by just using the definition). The next theorem highlights how to go in the reverse direction.
 
\begin{theorem}\label{thm.PolarToRectangular}
Let $z\in \mathbb{C}$. Then $|z| = r$ and $\Arg(z) = \theta$ if and only if $z = r\cos\theta + ir\sin\theta$ with $0\le \theta <2\pi$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.MultiplyComplex}
If $z_1 = r_1\cos\theta_1 + ir_1\sin\theta_1$ and $z_2=r_2\cos\theta_2 + ir_2\sin\theta_2$, then \[z_1z_2 = r_1r_2\cos(\theta_1+\theta_2) + ir_1r_2\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2).\]
\end{theorem}

The previous theorem shows that multiplying two complex numbers is rather easy when they are in ``polar form''. It yields two nice corollaries.

\begin{corollary}
If $z_1,z_2\in \mathbb{C}$, then $|z_1z_2| = |z_1||z_2|$ and $\Arg(z_1z_2) = \Arg(z_1)+\Arg(z_2)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}[De Moivre's formula]\label{cor.DeMoivre}
For each positive $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, \[\left(r\cos(\theta) + ir\sin(\theta)\right)^n = r^n\cos(n\theta) + ir^n\sin(n\theta).\]
\end{corollary}

We now arrive at an \emph{extremely important} definition.

\begin{definition}
For each positive $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, define \[\zeta_n := \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right).\]
Thus, $\zeta_n$ (read as ``zeta n'') is the unique  number with magnitude $1$ and argument $\frac{2\pi}{n}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}
Plot each of the following in the same complex plane: $\zeta_2$, $\zeta_3$, $\zeta_4$, $\zeta_5$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Plot each of the following in the same complex plane: $\zeta_6$, $(\zeta_6)^2$, $(\zeta_6)^3$, $(\zeta_6)^4$, $(\zeta_6)^5$, $(\zeta_6)^6$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Write $\overline{\zeta_8}$ as a power of $\zeta_8$. Conjecture a formula that expresses $\overline{(\zeta_n)^k}$ as a power of $\zeta_n$, but with no bar on top.
\end{problem}
