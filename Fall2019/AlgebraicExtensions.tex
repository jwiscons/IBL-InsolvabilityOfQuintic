Our goal remains: to show that there exist polynomials that are \emph{not} solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$. In Chapter~\ref{chapter:SolvabilityByRadicals}, we finally succeeded in properly formulating the notion of solvability by radicals, which we did in the language of field extensions. Additionally, we were able to catalog many polynomials that we are certain are solvable by radicals. Then, in Chapter~\ref{chapter:Rings}, we took a much closer look a polynomials, ultimately building a significant amount of language and theory to analyze polynomial rings over fields. The conclusion of the chapter hinted at the tight connection between polynomial rings and field extensions where we saw that $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2+1) \cong \mathbb{Q}(i)$. In this chapter, we will clarify this connection and exploit it to significantly deepen our understanding of extension fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ is a root of some polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.

\section{Algebraic elements}

Recall that a polynomial in $F[x]$ is solvable by radicals over $F$ if all of the roots of the polynomial lie in some radical extension of $F$. Our focus is on roots of polynomials, and the next definition gives us some language to highlight this.

\begin{definition}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$. An element $\alpha\in E$ is \textbf{algebraic} over $F$ if $p(\alpha) = 0$ for some nonzero $p(x)\in F[x]$. If $\alpha$ is not algebraic over  $F$, then it is said to be \textbf{transendental} over $F$. 
\end{definition}

To show an element $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$, we need only produce a polynomial \emph{with coefficients in $F$} for which $\alpha$ is a root. For example, the complex number $\sqrt{2}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ because $\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $p(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $p(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Also, $\pi$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{R}$ because $\pi$ is a root of $q(x) = x-\pi$ and $q(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$. However, it is \emph{much} harder to show that $\pi$ is \emph{not} algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ (so  $\pi$ is transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$). Incidentally, a set-theoretic argument  shows that almost all elements of $\mathbb{C}$ are transcendental over $\mathbb{Q}$; nevertheless, we will focus on algebraic elements.

\begin{problem}
Show that each of the following are algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$: $11$, $\sqrt[3]{11}$, $\zeta_{11}$, and $i$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Suppose that $\gamma \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\gamma^5 = 2\gamma^2 -7$. Explain why $\gamma$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob.Sqrt2PlusIIsAlgebraic}
Let $\alpha = \sqrt{2} + i$. Show that $\alpha$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{problem}

Now, an algebraic element over $F$ is a root of \emph{some} nonzero polynomial over $F$, but such an element will be a root of lots of polynomials. For example, since $\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $p(x) = x^2 - 2$, we find that for \emph{every} $q(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, $\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $q(x)p(x)$ because $q(\sqrt{2})p(\sqrt{2}) =  q(\sqrt{2})p(0) =0$. The polynomial $x^2 - 2$ is special because it is a polynomial \emph{of smallest degree} for which $\sqrt{2}$ is a root. In order to formalize this observation, we need to weave together several results from the last chapter. 

Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$, and suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$. Then $\alpha$ is the root of \emph{some} nonzero $p(x)\in F[x]$.  Let's look at the set of \emph{all} polynomials for which $\alpha$ is a root: $I = \{p(x)\in F[x]\mid p(\alpha) = 0\}$. By Theorem~\ref{thm.EvalHom}, ``evaluation at $\alpha$'' gives rise to a homomorphism $\mathcal{E}_\alpha: F[x] \to E[x]$, and notice that $I$ is precisely the kernel of $\mathcal{E}_\alpha$. Thus, by Theorem~\ref{thm.KernelIsIdealImageIsSubring}, $I$ is an ideal of $F[x]$, and since $F[x]$ is a PID, it must be that $I = (m(x))$ for some $m(x) \in F[x]$. 

Now, $m(x)$ is nonzero since $I$ contains some nonzero polynomial, and this also implies that $m(x)$ is not a constant polynomial since the only constant polynomial that has roots is the zero polynomial. Moreover, if $m(x)$ is not monic, we can make it monic by multiplying by the inverse of the leading coefficient and the result will still generate $I$ by Theorem~\ref{thm.DifferByUnitSameIdeal}. So, we may assume that $I = (m(x))$ with $m(x)$ nonconstant and monic. 

Also, notice that by Theorem~\ref{thm.PrincipalIdeals}, $m(x)$ divides every polynomial in $I$. So if $I = (n(x))$ for some other monic polynomial $n(x)$, then $m(x)$ and $n(x)$ would divide each other. In other words, $m(x) = a(x)n(x) = a(x)b(x)m(x)$ for some polynomials $a(x),b(x)\in F[x]$. Considering the degree of both sides of $m(x) = a(x)b(x)m(x)$, we see that $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ must be constant polynomials. But since $m(x) = a(x)n(x)$ with $m(x)$ and $n(x)$ both monic, the only conclusion is that $a(x) = 1$, so $m(x) = n(x)$. 

In summary, $I= \{p(x)\in F[x]\mid p(\alpha) = 0\}$ is an ideal, and there is a unique nonconstant monic polynomial $m(x)$ that generates $I$. In fact, more is true. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem.MinimalPolyIsIrreducible}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$, and suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$. Let $I = \{p(x)\in F[x]\mid p(\alpha) = 0\}$, and suppose that $I = (m(x))$ for some nonconstant $m(x) \in F[x]$. Then $m(x)$ is irreducible.
\end{lemma}

Combining Lemma~\ref{lem.MinimalPolyIsIrreducible} with our previous discussion, we arrive at the following fact.

\begin{fact}\label{fact.ExistsMinimalPoly}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$, and suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$. Then there is a unique irreducible monic polynomial $m(x) \in F[x]$ such that $m(\alpha) = 0$. Moreover, if $p(x) \in F[x]$ and $p(\alpha) = 0$, then $m(x)$ divides $p(x)$.
\end{fact}

The polynomial $m(x)$ from  Fact~\ref{fact.ExistsMinimalPoly} gets a special name.

\begin{definition}
Suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$. The unique irreducible monic polynomial $m(x) \in F[x]$ such that $m(\alpha) = 0$ is called the \textbf{minimal polynomial} of $\alpha$ over $F$. The \textbf{degree} of $\alpha$ over $F$ is defined to be the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$. Suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$, and let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$. If $V = \{p(x)\in F[x]\mid p(\alpha) = 0\}$ (i.e~the set of all polynomials that vanish at $\alpha$), then $V = (m(x))$.
\end{theorem}


We will see shortly that the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$ is key to understanding the field extension $F(\alpha)$. But how do we find the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$? The first step is to find \emph{any} monic polynomial $p(x)\in F[x]$ for which $p(\alpha) = 0$ (which also verifies that $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$). If we can show that $p(x)$ is irreducible, then $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial, and we're done. Otherwise, we factor $p(x)$ into irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$, and  by Fact~\ref{fact.ExistsMinimalPoly}, the minimal polynomial will be whichever one of the factors has $\alpha$ as a root. Let's test this out with some examples. 

\begin{problem}\label{prob.MinPolyZeta3}
Explain why the minimal polynomial for $\zeta_3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is \textit{not} $x^3-1$. Find the minimal polynomial  $\zeta_3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and determine the degree of  $\zeta_3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
The polynomial $p(x) = x^3-11$ has three roots in $\mathbb{C}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ of each of the three roots.
\item Find the degree over $\mathbb{R}$ of each of the three roots.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
The polynomial $p(x) = x^5-2x^3-3x$ has five roots in $\mathbb{C}$. Find the minimal polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$ of each of the five roots.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Let $z = a+bi$ with $a,b\in \mathbb{Q}$, and define $p(x) = (x-z)(x-\overline{z})$. Prove that $p(x)\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$, and then use this to find the minimal polynomial of $2+i$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Find the minimal polynomial of $3-\sqrt{5}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

\subsection{Describing $F(\alpha)$ when $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$}

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:Fields}, we explored extension fields of the form $F(\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ was chosen from some larger field $E$. However, the definition of $F(\alpha)$ was abstract and ofter hard to work with. For example, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is defined to be the smallest subfield of $\mathbb{C}$ containing $\mathbb{Q}$ and $i$, but this doesn't tell us much about what the elements of $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ actually look like. Nevertheless, in Problem~\ref{prob.QAdjoinI}, we were able show that $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ is precisely the set of elements of the form $a+bi$ with $a,b\in \mathbb{Q}$, and we also succeeded in showing that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}) = \{a+b\sqrt{5}\mid a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\}$. 

However, we noticed that describing $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is not always so easy since, for example, if $\alpha = \sqrt{2} + i$, then $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha) \neq \{a+b\alpha\mid a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\}$. That said, we've learned a lot since Chapter~\ref{chapter:Fields}, so let's take another go at trying to describe fields like $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$. 

Remember that (for $\alpha = \sqrt{2} + i$) we were able to show that $\{a+b\alpha\mid a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$, but the reverse containment did not hold. And, the reason the reverse containment didn't hold was because $\{a+b\alpha\mid a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\}$ is not a field, which can be seen fairly easily since $\alpha^2 \notin \{a+b\alpha\mid a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\}$ (so it's not closed under multiplication). 

So why not add in $\alpha^2$ and consider something like  $\{a+b\alpha + c\alpha^2\mid a,b,c\in \mathbb{Q}\}$? Remembering that $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ is a field containg $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha$ (and is closed under addition and multiplication), we see again that $\{a+b\alpha + c\alpha^2\mid a,b,c\in \mathbb{Q}\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$. So maybe $\{a+b\alpha + c\alpha^2\mid a,b,c\in \mathbb{Q}\} = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$. Or, maybe we need to look at $\{a+b\alpha + c\alpha^2 + d\alpha^3\mid a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{Q}\}$. These are all good ideas since $a_0+a_1\alpha + a_2\alpha^2 + a_3\alpha^3 + \cdots + a_n\alpha^n \in \mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ whenever $a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n\in \mathbb{Q}$. Let's formalize this.


\begin{theorem}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$, and let $\alpha\in E$. If $p(x)\in F[x]$, then $p(\alpha) \in F(\alpha)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{problem}
Let $p(x) = 2x^3+7x^2-\frac{1}{2}$. We know that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}) = \{a+b\sqrt{5}\mid a,b\in \mathbb{Q}\}$ by  Problem~\ref{prob.QAdjoinRoot5}. Verify directly that $p(\sqrt{5}) \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$ by writing $p(\sqrt{5})$ in the form $a+b\sqrt{5}$ for some $a,b\in \mathbb{Q}$.
\end{problem}

We are studying the elements we get when we plug $\alpha$ into polynomials. Let's frame this in terms of the evaluation homomorphism introduced in Theorem~\ref{thm.EvalHom}, like we did at the beginning of this chapter. The next theorem generalizes Problem~\ref{prob.EvalAtI}.

\begin{theorem}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$. Suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$, and let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$. If $\mathcal{E}_\alpha:F[x] \rightarrow E$ is the homomorphism defined by $\mathcal{E}_\alpha(p(x)) = p(\alpha)$, then 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the kernel of $\mathcal{E}_\alpha$ is $(m(x))$, and
\item the image of $\mathcal{E}_\alpha$ is contained in $F(\alpha)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Using Theorems~\ref{thm.MaximalIFFIrreducibleinFx} and~\ref{thm.QuotientIsField} (and the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings), we can deduce that the image of $\mathcal{E}_\alpha$ is a field. But then, if we can verify that the image of $\mathcal{E}_\alpha$ contains $F$ and $\alpha$, we can conclude that the image of $\mathcal{E}_\alpha$ is actually \emph{equal} to $F(\alpha)$ (by the definition of $F(\alpha)$). Let's put this together.

\begin{theorem}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$. Suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$, and let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$. Then 
$F(\alpha) \cong F[x]/(m(x)).$
\end{theorem}

Notice that we still haven't succeeded in providing a nice description $F(\alpha)$, but we will if we can find a nice description of $F[x]/(m(x))$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem.DescribeQuotientWithRemainders}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$, and suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$. Let $m(x)$ be the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$, and let $n$ be the degree of $\alpha$ over $F$.  If $a(x) + (m(x)) \in F[x]/(m(x))$, then $a(x) + (m(x)) =  r(x) + (m(x))$ where $r(x)$ is the remainder obtained when dividing $a(x)$ by $m(x)$. Consequently,
\[F[x]/(m(x)) = \{r(x) +  (m(x)) \mid \deg r(x) < n \text{ or } r(x) = 0\}.\]
\end{lemma}

Tying together all of our work, we finally arrive at our desired description of $F(\alpha)$.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr}
Let $F$ be a subfield of $E$. Suppose that $\alpha\in E$ is algebraic over $F$, and let $n$ be the degree of $\alpha$ over $F$. Then \[F(\alpha) = \{a_0 + a_1\alpha+\cdots+a_{n-1}\alpha^{n-1} \mid a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1} \in F\}.\]
\end{theorem}

We had to work hard for Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr}, but using it is fairly easy. For example, suppose we want to describe $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$. We first need to know the degree of $\sqrt[3]{2}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Of course, $\sqrt[3]{2}$ is a root of $m(x) = x^3-2$, and $m(x)$ is irreducible by Theorems~\ref{thm.nthRoots} and~\ref{thm.ReducibilityTestDegree2or3}. Thus, $m(x) = x^3-2$ is the minimal polynomial of $\sqrt[3]{2}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, so $\sqrt[3]{2}$ has degree $3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Now we  apply Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} to find that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2}) = \{a_0 + a_1\sqrt[3]{2}+a_{2}(\sqrt[3]{2})^{2} \mid a_0,a_1,a_2 \in \mathbb{Q}\}$.

\begin{problem}
Use  Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} to describe $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_3)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} Let $p(x) = x^3-x+1 \in \mathbb{Z}_3[x]$, and let $r$ be a root of $p(x)$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $p(x)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}_3[x]$. 
\item Use Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} to describe $\mathbb{Z}_3(r)$.
\item How many elements are in the field $\mathbb{Z}_3(r)$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}\label{prob.DescribeQAdjoinSqrt2PlusI}
Let $\alpha = \sqrt{2} + i$. In Problem~\ref{prob.Sqrt2PlusIIsAlgebraic}, we saw that $\alpha$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ since $\alpha$ is a root of  $x^4-2x^2+9\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Let $m(x)$ denote the minimal polynomial for $\alpha$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} (and Problem~\ref{prob.QAdjoinI}) to explain why the degree of $m(x)$ isn't $1$ or $2$.
\item Use Fact~\ref{fact.ExistsMinimalPoly} to explain why $m(x)$ is a factor of $x^4-2x^2+9$.
\item Explain why the degree of $m(x)$ isn't $3$.
\item Explain why  $m(x)=x^4-2x^2+9$.
\item Use Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} to describe $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} + i)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

The next problem highlights how we use the minimal polynomial for $\alpha$ to compute (or rather, to simplify) in  $F(\alpha)$.

\begin{problem}
The polynomial $p(x) = x^5 + 2x + 2$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ (you do not need to prove this). Let $s$ be a root of $p(x)$. By Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr}, every element of $\mathbb{Q}(s)$ can be written in the form $a_0 + a_1s + a_2s^2 + a_3s^3 + a_4s^4$ for some $a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4 \in \mathbb{Q}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the fact that $p(s) = 0$ to write $s^5$ in the form  $a_0 + a_1s + a_2s^2 + a_3s^3 + a_4s^4$.
\item Rewrite each of the following elements of $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)$ in the form  $a_0 + a_1s + a_2s^2 + a_3s^3 + a_4s^4$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(s^3+2)(s^3+3s)$
\item $3s^4(2+s^3)(5-s+s^2)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Let's try to describe $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)$. Notice that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i) = \left(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\right)(i)$. In words, the field obtained by adjoining $\sqrt{2} $ and $i$ at the same time is equal to the field obtained by first adjoining $\sqrt{2}$ and then adjoining $i$ to the result.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use  Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} to describe $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$.
\item Use Theorem~\ref{thm.ReducibilityTestDegree2or3} to explain why $x^2+1$ is the minimal polynomial of $i$ over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$.
\item Use  Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} to describe $\left(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\right)(i)$, which is equal to $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)$.
\item How does your description of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},i)$ compare to that for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2} + i)$ in Problem~\ref{prob.DescribeQAdjoinSqrt2PlusI}?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\subsection{Eisenstein's irreducibility criterion}

Theorem~\ref{thm.DescribeFAdjoinr} provides a nice description of $F(\alpha)$ when $\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$. However, the description rests on us knowing the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ over $F$, which in turn rests on us being able to determine when polynomials are irreducible. We now introduce an irreducibility criterion for $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.

\begin{fact}[Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion (EIC)]\label{fact.Eisenstein}
Let $p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_nx^n$ with all $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Suppose that there is some prime number $p \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that all of the following conditions are met:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p$ does \emph{not} divide $a_n$,
\item $p$ does divide $a_i$ for all $i<n$, and
\item $p^2$ does \emph{not} divide $a_0$.
\end{enumerate}
Then $p(x)$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$.
\end{fact}

The proof of the EIC is  interesting and not too difficult, but as it is more  number-theoretic than algebraic, we will leave it for another time. Details can be found in other books or on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenstein\%27s_criterion}{Wikipedia}. The idea is to take the polynomial $p(x)$ whose coefficients are all integers and consider it as a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ by reducing all of the coefficients modulo $p$. 

\begin{problem}
Use the EIC to show that $x^{8}-15$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$. What did you choose as your prime $p$? Were there other choices?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the polynomial $ f(x) = x^7 - \frac{5}{2}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain why the EIC does \emph{not} apply to $f(x)$.
\item Prove that if $f(x)$ is reducible in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, then so is $g(x) = 2x^7 - 5$.
\item Use the EIC to show that $g(x)$ is irreducible, and conclude that $f(x)$ is also irreducible.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

Let's try to determine the minimal polynomial of  $\zeta_5$. We know that $\zeta_5$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$ because it is a root of $x^5-1$. However, $x^5-1$ can not be the minimal polynomial since it has $x-1$ as a factor.
